# Module `:compiler`

Native JVM Bytecode Compiler for `.pvm` PaniniVM script files.

## Canonical sūtra programs

Segmented Sanskrit `.pvm` source can be emitted as an evaluator-free `.sutra`
grantha and processed by the public VM API:

```kotlin
val result = PaniniVM().evalGranthaFile(File("addition.sutra"))
```

`evalGrantha(source)` accepts the canonical text directly. Both entry points
decode, validate, compile, dependency-order, and execute the grantha through the
sūtra machine. Successful results retain their typed Sanskrit value; malformed
source and invalid granthas are returned as ordinary `ExecutionResult.Failure`
values.

During execution, the compiled grantha is automatically installed as the
current grantha in the immutable sūtra registry. It can therefore inspect its
own sūtras and resolve explicitly imported, exported sūtras without the host
manually registering the application.

The sūtra machine is the sole execution architecture for ordinary
`PaniniVM.eval(...)` calls. The former parallel execution pipeline has been
retired.

## Named local values

PVM assignment and reference syntax remains a segmented Sanskrit sentence.
With `दा`, the `KARMAN` value is bound to the literal name supplied as
`SAMPRADANA`:

```text
एक + अम् आरम्भ + ङे दा + लोट् + सिप् ।
आरम्भ + अम् द्वि + औट् च युज् + णिच् + लोट् + सिप् ।
```

The first sentence binds the typed value `एक` to `आरम्भ`. The second sentence
resolves `आरम्भ` as that local value and produces three. Bindings persist in a
named VM session and are emitted as ordinary entries by compiled programs.

## Segmented loops

A `यावत्` condition can govern a multi-sentence body. The first body sentence
starts with `तावत्`; subsequent sentences start with `ततः`:

```text
यावत् गणना + अम् शून्य + अम् च विद् + णिच् + लोट् + सिप्
तावत् पूर्व + अम् वर्तमान + औट् च युज् + णिच् + लोट् + सिप्
ततः फल + अम् अग्रिम + ङे दा + लोट् + सिप्
ततः गणना + अम् एक + औट् च वि + युज् + णिच् + लोट् + सिप्
ततः फल + अम् गणना + ङे दा + लोट् + सिप् ।
वृत् + यङ् + लोट् + थास् ।
```

The condition must produce `सत्य`. Assignments in the body are visible to the
next iteration. A 100,000-iteration limit guards against accidental endless
loops. Compiled scripts emit JVM branches for the loop and reevaluate the
condition at runtime; the compiler does not expand or execute loop iterations.
The final `वृत् + यङ् + लोट्` sentence is mandatory: `वृत्` selects the existing
`LoopAction`, and `यङ्` marks क्रियासमभिहार, repeated execution.

## Overview

The `:compiler` module compiles multi-clause segmented Sanskrit `.pvm` script files directly into native JVM `.class` bytecode:
- **`BytecodeCompiler`**: Generates JVM bytecode carrying stack constants, AST invocations, and runtime continuations.
- **`PaniniRuntime`**: Host execution environment for compiled bytecode execution.
- **`PvmUktiSadhaka`**: Evaluates parsed AST nodes to perform full `rūpa-siddhi` (रूपसिद्धि) on segmented `.pvm` script lines.
